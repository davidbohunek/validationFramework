# ValidationFramework
Universal validation framework enabling rich and complex validation rules for both server and client side with single point of configuration (server side).
Validation rules are set on the server only and then can be then serialized and sent to client (Javascript) for reuse. 
The project is in very early stage and currently doesn't have any working code. Work in progress!

# Supported server platforms
When done, following server platforms will be supported:
C# (MVC, WebApi, WebForms), NodeJs, Java (Spring)
Additional platforms are possible (PHP, Python, Ruby)

# Supported client platforms
Any browser based application or JavaScript enabled application.
Special adapters for AngularJS, EmberJS, WinJS (and more) will be created for most confortable consuming.
